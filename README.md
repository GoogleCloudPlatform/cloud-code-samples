# Code Templates for Google Cloud Code

## What is Google Cloud Code

Cloud Code brings the power and convenience of IDEs to cloud-native application development. Cloud Code integrates with Google Cloud services like Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run, Cloud APIs and Secret Manager, and makes you feel like you are working with local code.

Cloud Code works with Googleâ€™s command-line container tools like skaffold, minikube, and kubectl under the hood, providing local, continuous feedback on your project as you build, edit, run, and deploy your applications locally or in the cloud. Cloud Code also deeply integrates with Cloud SDK to provide a unified authentication experience when you develop with Google Cloud Services.
