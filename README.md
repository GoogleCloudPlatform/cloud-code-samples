# Code Templates for Google Cloud Code

## What is Google Cloud Code

Building highly scalable applications with Kubernetes can be hard.
Google Cloud Code extends your IDE so that you can continuously deploy to a cluster, edit and debug just like you were working with local code.
Spend less time learning about configuration and management of your app - and spend more time to focus on writing and evolving your code.

## What's in this repo

Code templates for easy Getting-Started experience with Google Cloud Code in Python, Java, Nodejs, Go and .NET Core.
We support two IDEs: Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ.
