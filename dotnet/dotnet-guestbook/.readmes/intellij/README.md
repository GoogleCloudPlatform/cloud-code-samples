# Guestbook with Cloud Code

The Guestbook sample demonstrates how to deploy a Kubernetes application with a front end service and a back end service using the [Cloud Code extension for IntelliJ](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/intellij/install?utm_source=ext&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=CDR_kri_gcp_cloudcodereadmes_012521&utm_content=-). When you run the application, Cloud Code uses [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/) under the hood to build an image and deploy the project's Kubernetes manifests. To learn more about Kubernetes, explore the [Kubernetes overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/).

## Getting Started

### Run the app locally with minikube

#### Start a minikube cluster
1. Navigate to the Kubernetes Explorer from the right side panel, or by going to **Tools > Cloud Code > Kubernetes > View Cluster Explorer**. 

2. If the Cluster Explorer is empty, go to the terminal and run 'minikube start'.

3. Once minikube has started, it will be displayed in the Cluster Explorer. Minikube will be set as the current context by default. To switch contexts, right click on a different cluster in the Cluster Explorer and select 'Set as Current Context'.

#### Run the app on minikube
1. Click the Run/Debug configurations dropdown on the top taskbar and select 'Edit Configurations'. Select 'Develop on Kubernetes'. You may need to specify your [container image repository](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/intellij/configuring-container-image-settings?utm_source=ext&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=CDR_kri_gcp_cloudcodereadmes_012521&utm_content=-).

2. Click 'OK' to save your configuration. 

3. Select 'Develop on Kubernetes' from the configuration drop down and click the run icon. Cloud Code runs your app in a local [minikube](ttps://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) cluster.

4. View the build process in the output window. Once the build has finished, you will receive a notification from the Event Log. Click 'View' to access the local URLs for your deployed services. The URLs remain accessible through the Event Log dialog.

5.  To stop the application, click the stop icon next to the configuration dropdown.

### Run the app remotely on Google Kubernetes Engine

#### Set up a GKE cluster

1. Navigate to the Kubernetes Explorer from the right side panel, or by going to **Tools > Cloud Code > Kubernetes > View Cluster Explorer**. 

2. Click '+' to create a new cluster, or go to **Tools > Cloud Code > Kubernetes > Add GKE Cluster**.

3. If prompted, log in to your GCP account and select a project.

4. Click 'Create a new GKE cluster`. You will be directed to the Google Cloud Console to create your new cluster.

5. Once your GKE cluster has been created, it will be displayed in the Cluster Explorer.  
![image](./img/added-cluster.png)

6. Your new cluster will be set as the current context by default. To switch contexts, right click on a different cluster in the Cluster Explorer and select 'Set as Current Context'. 

#### Deploy app to GKE

1. Select 'Run on Kubernetes' from the configuration drop down and click the 'Run' button.

2. View the build process in the output window. Once the build has finished, you will receive a notification from the Event Log. Click 'View' to access the local URLs for your deployed services. The URLs remain accessible through the Event Log dialog.
