# Guestbook with Cloud Code

The Guestbook sample demonstrates how to deploy a Kubernetes application with a front end service and a back end service using the Cloud Code extension for Cloud Shell. When you run the application, Cloud Code uses [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/) under the hood to build an image and deploy the project's Kubernetes manifests. To learn more about Kubernetes, explore the [Kubernetes overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/).

## What's in this sample
### Kubernetes architecture
![Kubernetes Architecture Diagram](../../img/diagram.png)

### Directory contents

- `skaffold.yaml` - A schema file that defines skaffold configurations ([skaffold.yaml reference](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/))
- `kubernetes-manifests/` - Contains Kubernetes YAML files for the Guestbook services and deployments, including:

  - `guestbook-frontend.deployment.yaml` - deploys a pod with the frontend container image
  - `guestbook-frontend.service.yaml` - creates a load balancer and exposes the frontend service on an external IP in the cluster
  - `guestbook-backend.deployment.yaml` - deploys a pod with the backend container image
  - `guestbook-backend.service.yaml` - exposes the backend service on an internal IP in the cluster
  - `guestbook-mongodb.deployment.yaml` - deploys a pod containing a MongoDB instance
  - `guestbook-mongodb.service.yaml` - exposes the MongoDB service on an internal IP in the cluster

## Getting Started

### Run the app locally with minikube

1. To run your application, click on the Cloud Code status bar and select ‘Run on Kubernetes’.  
![image](./img/status-bar.png)

2. Select ‘Run locally using minikube’ when prompted. Cloud Code runs your app in a local [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) cluster.

3. If prompted, authorize Cloud Shell to use your credentials to make a GCP API call.

4. View the build progress in the OUTPUT window. Once the build has finished, click on the front end service's URL in the OUTPUT window to view your live application.

5.  To stop the application, click the stop icon in the Debug Explorer.

### Run the app remotely on Google Kubernetes Engine

#### Set up a GKE cluster

1. From the command palette, run "Create GKE cluster".

2. Follow the steps to configure your cluster and click "Create Cluster". Once your cluster has been created, it will be displayed in the Google Kubernetes Engine Explorer.

3. Your new cluster will be set as the active cluster by default. To switch clusters, right click on a different cluster in the GKE Explorer and select “Set as Active Cluster”.

#### Deploy app to GKE

1. Click on the Cloud Code status bar and select ‘Run on Kubernetes’.

2. If prompted, confirm the current context and image registry.
