# Kubernetes Hello World with Cloud Code

This "Hello World" sample demonstrates how to deploy a simple "Hello World" application to Kubernetes using the [Cloud Code extension for IntelliJ](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/intellij/install?utm_source=ext&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=CDR_kri_gcp_cloudcodereadmes_012521&utm_content=-). When you run the application, Cloud Code uses [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/) under the hood to build an image and deploy the project's Kubernetes manifests. To learn more about Kubernetes, explore the [Kubernetes overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/).

- `skaffold.yaml` - A schema file that defines skaffold configurations ([skaffold.yaml reference](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/))
- `kubernetes-manifests/` - Contains Kubernetes YAML files for the Guestbook services and deployments, including:

  - `hello.deployment.yaml` - deploys a pod with the 'java-hello-world' container image
  - `hello.service.yaml` - creates a load balancer and exposes the 'java-hello-world' service on an external IP in the cluster

<h4 id="edit-run-configuration"> Edit run configuration </h4>

1. Click the configuration dropdown in the top taskbar and then click **Edit Configurations**.
![image](../../img/edit-configurations.png)

   The **Develop on Kubernetes** configuration watches for changes, then uses [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/) to rebuild and rerun your app. You can customize your deployment by making changes to this run configuration or by creating a new Cloud Code: Kubernetes run configuration.

3. Under **Run > Deployment**, select 'Deploy locally to a minikube cluster'.

4. Click **OK** to save your configuration.


<h4 id="run-the-app-on-minikube"> Run the app on minikube </h4>

1. Select **Develop on Kubernetes** from the configuration dropdown and click the run icon. Cloud Code runs your app in a local [minikube](ttps://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) cluster.

2. View the build process in the output window. When the deployment is successful, you're notified that new service URLs are available. Click the Service URLs tab to view the URL(s), then click the URL link to open your browser with your running application.

3. To stop the application, click the stop icon next to the configuration dropdown.

<h4 id="set-up-a-gke-cluster"> Set up a GKE cluster </h4>

1. Navigate to the Kubernetes Explorer from the right side panel, or by going to **Tools > Cloud Code > Kubernetes > View Cluster Explorer**. 

2. Click **+** to create a new cluster, or go to **Tools > Cloud Code > Kubernetes > Add GKE Cluster**.

6. Your new cluster will be set as the current context by default. To switch contexts, right click on a different cluster in the Cluster Explorer and select **Set as Current Context**. 

<h4 id="deploy-app-to-gke"> Deploy app to GKE </h4>

1. Select **Develop on Kubernetes** from the configuration dropdown and click the run icon. 

2. View the build process in the output window. When the deployment is successful, you're notified that new service URLs are available. Click the Service URLs tab to view the URL(s), then click the URL link to open your browser with your running application.
