### Before you begin

1. If you're new to Google Cloud, [create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial/signup/tos) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads.

1. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or [create a Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard).

    **Note**: If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

1. Make sure that billing is enabled for your Cloud project. Learn how to [check if billing is enabled on a project](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled).

1. [Enable the following APIs](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/projectselector2/apis/enableflow?apiid=cloudfunctions,cloudbuild.googleapis.com,artifactregistry.googleapis.com,run.googleapis.com,logging.googleapis.com,pubsub.googleapis.com&redirect=https:%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Ffunctions%2Fdocs%2Fcreate-deploy-nodejs):

    * Cloud Functions
    * Cloud Build
    * Artifact Registry
    * Cloud Run
    * Logging
    * Pub/Sub
    
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Git is required for copying samples to your machine.

1. Install the [Cloud Code plugin](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/install#installing) if you haven't already.

1. Since Cloud Functions integration is currently a pre-release feature, you'll also need to [install the pre-release build](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/insiders#get).

#### Create a function

To create a new function using this sample, follow these steps:

1. Click ![Cloud Code icon](https://cloud.google.com/static/code/docs/vscode/images/cloudcode-icon.png) **Cloud Code** and then expand the **Cloud Functions** section.

1. Click **+ Create function** and select the **Python: Hello World** template.

1. Navigate to the pathway that you'd like to create your new function in, enter a name for the function, and select **Create New Application**.

1. If the folder of your application doesn't appear automatically in the **Explorer**, click ![VS Code Refresh icon](https://cloud.google.com/static/code/docs/vscode/images/refresh-icon.png) **Refresh**.

#### Deploy a function

To deploy a function, follow these steps:

1. Right-click a function and select **Deploy function**.

1. In the Quickpick menu, select a GCP project to deploy your function to.

1. Select a region that the function will be deployed to.

1. Select a runtime.

The function's deployment may take a few minutes.

If the deployment fails, refer to the **Output** tab for the error message. Clicking the link takes you to the build logs in Google Cloud console and provides more detail about the error.
