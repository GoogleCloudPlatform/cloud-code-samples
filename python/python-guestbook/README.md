# Guestbook with Cloud Code

The Guestbook sample demonstrates how to deploy a Kubernetes application with a front end service and a back end service using the Cloud Code IDE extension.  

For details on how to use this sample as a template in Cloud Code, read the documentation for Cloud Code for [VS Code](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/quickstart-local-dev?utm_source=ext&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=CDR_kri_gcp_cloudcodereadmes_012521&utm_content=-) or [IntelliJ](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/intellij/quickstart-k8s?utm_source=ext&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=CDR_kri_gcp_cloudcodereadmes_012521&utm_content=-).

## Getting Started with VS Code

### Run the app locally with minikube

1. To run your application, click on the Cloud Code status bar and select ‘Run on Kubernetes’.

## Getting Started with IntelliJ

### Run the app locally with minikube

#### Start a minikube cluster
1. Navigate to the Kubernetes Explorer from the right side panel, or by going to **Tools > Cloud Code > Kubernetes > View Cluster Explorer**. 

2. If the Cluster Explorer is empty, go to the terminal and run 'minikube start'.

3. Once minikube has started, it will be displayed in the Cluster Explorer. Minikube will be set as the current context by default. To switch contexts, right click on a different cluster in the Cluster Explorer and select 'Set as Current Context'.

#### Run the app on minikube
1. Click the Run/Debug configurations dropdown on the top taskbar and select 'Edit Configurations'. Select 'Develop on Kubernetes'. You may need to specify your [container image repository](https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/intellij/configuring-container-image-settings?utm_source=ext&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=CDR_kri_gcp_cloudcodereadmes_012521&utm_content=-).

2. Click 'OK' to save your configuration. 

3. Select 'Develop on Kubernetes' from the configuration drop down and click the run icon. Cloud Code runs your app in a local [minikube](ttps://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) cluster.

4. View the build process in the output window. Once the build has finished, you will receive a notification from the Event Log. Click 'View' to access the local URLs for your deployed services. The URLs remain accessible through the Event Log dialog.
